our eyes were fixed on the flat line in the distance, sporadically broken by
small bushels of grass or the odd cloud. the sun was already
getting close to hiding behind it, shedding its last light onto our skin. the
grass emitted a light green, the patches of raw dirt shone in earthy orange that
looked almost fungal.

we liked it here. the evenings were usually filled with many rounds of chess and
a few small words. we both had talked enough, more than the lives of two people
should usually hold and we we're long tired of it. our days and nights need no
more talking, our mouths only opening for jawning and eating.

our nutritional goals were hit easily, often eating a little extra at the cost
of a few years less in this place, but that's a deal we we're willing to make.
hyper-compressed food tastes metallic, but i've never asked anyone why that is.
guess it's too late now. there's this taste in all we eat that could make anyone
with a higher culinary standards go mad in the span of weeks.

since our stationing here 26 years ago, nothing really happend. there was that
incident a while back that we took a lot of measures to document, but to be
fair, that excitement only lasted for a few days. there's not much to this
place, other than the view. the same ground in every direction, nothing but the
clouds moving above us. i'll still marvel at the lines in the distance from time
to time. i wonder how they've made it so flat.

supposedly, the whole planet is like this. nothing but flat grass and the
occasional cloud. supposedly, it's for economic reasons. it seemed cheaper to
just tear down the whole planet and start fresh, you know. getting rid of
everything took a while, but rebuilding is going to take even longer. my
coworker told me the other day that there's been another pushback of a century
or so. bureaucrazy.
